* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact assessment, including how an attacker might exploit the issue
